# C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms Cheat Sheet

These are two cheat sheets I put together describing both basic [C++ syntax](C++\ Syntax.md) and many common [data structures and algorithms](Data\ Structures\ and\ Algorithms.md) in C++ for my past interviews at Google, NASA, etc.

Hopefully you find them useful, and please open an issue or submit a PR if you find incorrect or missing information!
